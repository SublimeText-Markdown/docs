# Sublime Text Markdown Organization

This GitHub organization aims to bring together all the effort that's related to Markdown and Sublime Text editor.

Currently there are too many Sublime Text plugins that are trying to do the very same things for Markdown. With this organization, it is planned to bring those plugins together and possibly merge some of them.

This repository (`docs`) is for any type of documentation and discussion.

Feedback is welcome via pull requests and [issues][1].

## Goals

These are the abstract goals of the organization:

* Providing a powerful Markdown syntax highlighting for Sublime Text
* Providing support for the famous Markdown flavors
* Providing decent color scheme(s) for Markdown
* Providing powerful but straightforward and easy to learn Markdown editing features for Sublime Text
* Providing easy ways to preview or convert Markdown text to HTML and other formats
